# My First Repo: Learning Python
## Resouces for Learning Python 
I started learning Python by completing the ["Try It: Intro to Python"](https://www.edx.org/course/intro-python) course on edX. I am keeping a list of other I started learning  resources I have found helpful in [this file](my-first-repo/python_coding_resources.md). I will keep updating this list as I learn more.
## Python Projects
Here are the Python projects I have completed so far:

* **[Hello World](my-first-repo/hello_world)**, a basic Python program that prints text

I will add additional projects to this repo as I complete them.
